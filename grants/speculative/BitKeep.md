### BitSwap
BitSwap is a cross-chain DEFI transaction aggregator launched by BitKeep, supporting bi-directional exchange of any coins between this public chain and heterogeneous chains. Currently, in addition to aggregating decentralized transaction channels such as Uniswap, justswap, and Shushiswap, it also aggregates the centralized lightning exchange service (SWFT), and will subsequently aggregate and support high-quality exchange protocols on Polkadot Chain to achieve the optimal exchange solution BitSwap takes advantage of BitKeep's big data services to automatically filter fake currency exchanges and safeguard user assets. When users exchange currencies, BitSwap automatically finds the best price among multiple exchange protocols and simplifies the tedious exchange process to achieve a one-click exchange experience on the go.

## Ecosystem Fit 
Yes there are similar projects to us like imtoken wallet, math wallet, they only offer their native exchange with in the wallet and have Dapp browser on the other hand BitKeep provides DEX aggregator which also supports cross chain transactions using multiple dexes and SWFT, we offer DAPP store instead of browser which gives one click experience to the user with in the wallet connected automatically.
